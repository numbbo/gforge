Installation
============

To install COCO, provided that the minimal requirements are met (see
:ref:`requirements` below), you only need to:

1. download the *first* archive :file:`bbobexpXX.XX.tar.gz` from the `COCO download page <http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=downloads>`_. 
2. extract the archive

To check that COCO is running correctly, please proceed to :doc:`firsttime`.

Requirements
------------

Running Experiments
___________________

The interface for running experiments is provided in C/C++, Matlab/Gnu Octave,
Java, R and Python. An algorithm to be tested with COCO has to be adapted to work
with either of these versions.

Our code has been tested with:

* C/C++ gcc 4.2.1 and higher, the code provided is ANSI C,
* Matlab R2008a and higher
* Java 1.6, the code uses the Java Native Interface to call a library created
  from the C/C++ version of the code
* Python 2.6, 2.7
* R 2.14.2

Python and Post-Processing
__________________________

The requirements below are for the post-processing tool of COCO that runs in Python.

.. note::
..   All packages are easily available for 32-bit Python 2.X.
     Using 64-bit Python 2.X is possible but not straightforward.

   Numpy and Matplotlib do not work with Python 3.X.
   
Needed are

* `python 2.6.x or 2.7.x <http://www.python.org/>`_ (**not python 3.x**)

* `numpy 1.2.1 or later <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ (the version must fit to the python version)

* `matplotlib 1.0.1 or later <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ (the version must fit to the python version)

All three are part of 

* Anaconda_ (first choice)

* `Enthought python distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_ and 

* Sage_ (then ``sage`` instead of ``python`` must be used). 

Documents and articles that aggregate tables and figures are generated using
`LaTeX <http://www.latex-project.org/>`_

How do I install on Windows?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For installing Python under Windows, either install Anaconda_ or Enthought_ or go to the `Python download page <http://www.python.org/download/>`_
and download the Python Windows Installer :file:`python-2.7.X.msi` (the default Windows is for Win 32 architecture).
This file requires the Microsoft Installer, which is a part of Windows XP and later releases.
`Numpy`_ and `Matplotlib`_
can be installed with the standard :file:`.exe` files which are respectively:

* :file:`numpy-X-win32-superpack-python2.X.exe` and,
* :file:`matplotlib-X.win32-py2.X.exe`.

How do I install on Linux?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Either install Anaconda_ or Sage_ or Enthought_. 
Otherwise, Python is usually already part of the installation. If
not, use your favorite package manager to install Python (package name:
python). The same needs to be done for Numpy (python-numpy) and
Matplotlib (python-matplotlib) and their dependencies.  

How do I install on Mac OS X?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Either install Anaconda_ or Sage_ or Enthought_. Otherwise, 
Mac OS X comes with Python pre-installed but if your version of Python is
2.5 or earlier, you might need to `upgrade <http://www.python.org/download/mac/>`_.

You then need to download and install `Numpy`_ and `Matplotlib`_:

* :file:`numpy-X-py2.X-python.org-macosx10.X.dmg`
* :file:`matplotlib-X-python.org-32bit-py2.X-macosx10.X.dmg`

           is not relevant for the use of COCO.

Interactive Python
------------------

In order to fully enjoy a Python shell, we enable tab-completion on Unix systems like 

.. sourcecode:: python 

    >>> import rlcompleter
    >>> import readline
    >>> readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

or we use IPython_. In order to have a matlab-like environment with hundreds of additional commands directly available (including the ``plot`` command) use 

.. sourcecode:: python 

    >>> from pylab import *

or 

.. sourcecode:: python 

    >>> import pylab as pl

which provides ``pl.plot`` etc. 

See also :ref:`pylabInteractive`.
