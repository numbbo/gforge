The data found here correspond to experimental data obtained for the
Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking workshop at GECCO'2015 (BBOB 2015)
(http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2015).

The data are human-readable ASCII files which were obtained using the
function fgeneric for which the sources and documentation can be found at:
http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2015-downloads

Note that, starting from 2015, we do not provide the previous python-formatted
data in order to allow for further developments of the post-processing code.

We list here the algorithms:

RF1-CMAES, and RF5-CMAES, two data sets are available that only differ
in the instances used in the experiments.
