The data was originally submitted to the BBOB-2017 workshop and the
data are cleaned-up versioned of the files

EvoSpacePSO-GA-final.zip
SSEABC.tar.gz
CMAES-APOP.resubmitted.tgz
DTS-CMA-ES_1000FED-finalresubmission.tgz
KL-BIPOP.tgz
KL-IPOP.tgz
KL-Restart.tgz
Ord-H-DTS-resubmitted.tgz
Ord-N-DTS-resubmitted.tgz
Ord-Q-DTS-resubmitted.tgz and Ord-Q-DTS_20D-resubmitted.7z combined
CMA-ES-pitra2017-resubmitted.tgz

in the folder coco/BBOB/workshops/2017-GECCO/submissions-data/.


Notes: 
* The original submission DTS-CMA-ES-resubmitted.tgz was later on
  replaced by longer experiments in DTS-CMA-ES_1000FED-finalresubmission.tgz
  after we asked the authors to do so.
* Ord-Q-DTS-resubmitted.tgz and Ord-Q-DTS_20D-resubmitted.7z were
  joined after the 20-D data has been submitted by the authors after the 
  submission deadline but before BBOB-2017. I (Dimo) removed the first entries in
  all 20-D .info files for everything that is related to instance 1 and
  the files bbobexp_f??_DIM??.dat. All data in the bbobexp-01_f??_DIM??.dat
  files have been kept, even if this amounts to 45 instances per function/dimension
  pair in 20-D.
* The MATLAB version of CMA-ES, submitted and used within BBOB-2017 by Pitra et al. 
  do not contain 20-D data (yet) and are therefore not counting as official COCO 
  data (and are thus also not available online so far).
