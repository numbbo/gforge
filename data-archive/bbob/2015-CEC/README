The data found here correspond to experimental data obtained for the special
session Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking at CEC'2015 (CEC-BBOB 2015)
(http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=cec-bbob-2015).

The data are human-readable ASCII files which were obtained using the

Note that, starting from 2015, we do not provide the previous python-formatted
data in order to allow for further developments of the post-processing code.
