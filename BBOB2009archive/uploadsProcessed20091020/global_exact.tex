\section{Introduction}

The multistart clustering global optimization method called GLOBAL \cite{csendes1988}
has been introduced in the 1980s for bound constrained global optimization problems
with black-box type objective function. The algorithm is based on Boender's algorithm \cite{boender1982} and it's goal is to find all local minimizer points that are potentially global. The local search procedures used by GLOBAL was either a quasi-Newton procedure with the DFP update formula or a random walk type direct search
method called UNIRANDI \cite{jarvi1973}. The GLOBAL it was originally coded in Fortran and C language.

Based on the old GLOBAL method we introduced a new version \cite{csendes2008} coded in MATLAB.
The algorithm was carefully studied, and was modified in some places to
achieve better reliability and efficiency while allowing higher dimensional problems
to be solved. In the new version we use the quasi-Newton local search method with
the BFGS update instead of the earlier DFP. We also combined GLOBAL with other local search methods like the Nelder-Mead simplex method. All the three version (Fortran, C, MATLAB) of the algorithm is freely available  for academic and nonprofit purposes at {\tt www.inf.u-szeged.hu/$\sim$csendes/regist.php} (after registration and limited for
low dimensional problems).

In this paper, the algorithm is benchmarked on the noisyfree BBOB 2009
testbed  \cite{wp200901, hansen2009fun} according to the experimental design from \cite{hansen2009exp}.

\section{Algorithm Presentation}

The GLOBAL method has two phases: a global and a local one. The global phase consist of sampling and clustering, while the local phase is based on local searches. The local minimizers
will be found by means of a local search procedure, starting from appropriately
chosen points from the sample drawn uniformly within the set of feasibility. In
an effort to identify the region of attraction of a local minimum, the procedure
invokes a clustering procedure. The main algorithm steps of it are summarized in
Algorithm 1:

\begin{algorithm}

\caption{A concise description of the GLOBAL optimization algorithm}

\begin{description}
\item[Step 1:] Draw $N$ points with uniform distribution in $X$, and add them to the
current cumulative sample $C$. Construct the transformed sample $T$ by taking
the $\gamma$ percent of the points in $C$ with the lowest function value.

\item[Step 2:] Apply the clustering procedure to $T$ one by one. If all points of $T$ can be
assigned to an existing cluster, go to Step 4

\item[Step 3:] Apply the local search procedure to the points in $T$ not yet
clustered. Repeat Step 3 until every point has been assigned to a cluster.

\item[Step 4:]If a new local minimizer has been found, go to Step 1.

\item[Step 5:] Determine the smallest local minimum value found, and stop.
\end{description} \label{a1}
\end{algorithm}



\section{Experimental Procedure}

GLOBAL has six parameters to set: the number of sample points, the number of best points selected, the stopping criterion parameter for the local search, the maximum number of function evaluations for local search, the maximum number of local minima, the used local method. All these parameters have a default value and usually it needs to change only the first three.

In all dimensions and functions we used 300 sample points, and 2 best points. In 2,3 and 5 dimension the local search tolerance was $10^{-8}$, the maximum number of function evaluations for local search 5000 and the local search was the simplex method. In 10 and 20 dimensions with the 3,4,7,16,23 functions we used the previous settings with $10^{-9}$ local search tolerance. In the case of the remained functions we used the previous parameters with 10000 number of maximum function evaluation and with the BFGS local search method.

The corresponding crafting effort is: $CrE_{10}=CrE_{20}=-(\frac{5}{24}\ln\frac{5}{24}+\frac{19}{24}\ln\frac{19}{24})=0.5117$

\section{CPU timing experiment}

For the timing experiment the GLOBAL algorithm
was run on f8 and restarted until at least 30 seconds had
passed (according to Figure 2 in \cite{hansen2009exp}). These experiments
have been conducted with an Intel
Core 2 Duo 2.00 GHz under Windows XP using MATLAB 7.6.0.324 version. We have done two experiments using the BFGS and the Simplex local search methods. The other algorithm parameters were the same. In the first case (BFGS) the results were $2.8; 2.9; 3.0; 3.0; 3.2$ and $3.2 {\times} 10^{-4}$, while in the second case (Simplex) were $2.6; 2.9; 3.4; 4.6; 7.5$ times $10^{-4}$ and $2.1 {\times} 10^{-3}$,
seconds per function evaluation in dimension 2; 3; 5; 10; 20
and 40, respectively.
