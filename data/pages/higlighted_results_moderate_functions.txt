Empirical runtime distributions on //moderate// functions (f6: Attractive Sector, f7: Step Ellipsoid, f8: Rosenbrock, f9: Rotated Rosenbrock) with target values in {100, ..., 1e-8} in dimension 20.

The following algorithms perform particularly well up to their individual maximum number of function evaluations:  //NEWUOA// (NEW Unconstraint Optimization Algorithm builds a second order model using 2n+1 points and with minimal Frobenius norm) and //IPOP-SEP-CMA-ES// (CMA-ES restarted with Increasing POPulation size, first run with SEParable CMA).
