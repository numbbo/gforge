~~NOCACHE~~

This is the old COCO download page. Please note that we moved in 2015 to github (see [[http://github.com/numbbo/coco/|our web page there]]) where you find the newest version of the code. Although this page here will remain to offer access to the last version before the move, we recommend to use [[http://github/numbbo/coco/|the newest version]].

**NEW FEATURES AND BUGFIXES in release 15.03 (Nov 17, 2015) in comparison to 15.02 (Dec 10, 2014):**
  * cosmetics of some figures
  * minor bugfixes
  * consistency check
  * rld-single-fcts functionality added
  * LaTeX templates corrected
  * cleanup rungenerics options
  * skip data extraction if already extracted
  * new html output
  * fixed unit tests
  * allow to compare more than 52 algorithms

**BUGS for older versions:**
  * **Bugs in version 15.01**:
     * CPU Timing section in LaTeX templates had no text
     * changeAlgIdAndComment.py and consistency_check() not fully consistent with arbitrary folder structure and 2009 setting respectively
  * **Bugs in version 15.00**:
     * compare two algorithm templates did not support expensive setting
     * CEC LaTeX templates for two algorithm comparison not available
  * **Bugs in version 13.09**:
     * Several inconsistencies in LaTeX templates with expensive setting 
  * **Bugs in version 13.08**:
     * Typos in the R version for running experiments
  * **Bugs in version 13.07**:
     * Too small lower y-limit for the display in scaling figures (ppfigdim)
  * **Bugs in version 13.05**:
     * Data consistency check produces an error instead of a warning (self.funcId instead of str(self.funcId) is attempted to print)  
  * **Bugs in version 13.04**: 
     * Data from trials for the same function and dimension that are distributed over several folders in a deep folder structure are possibly not read in correctly. 
  * **Bugs in version 13.03**: 
     * The computation of maximal function evaluations for a single run was based on the last reached target. Reverted to the true maximal evaluations iff the final target was not reached. 
  * **Bugs in version 13.01/2**: 
     * the (last) data entry to reach the final target has been cut away during read-in. This could have significant effects on the displays, in particular for algorithms that improved largely in this step. 
  * **Bugs in version 10.71?-12.xx**: 
     * zero or negative f-values were replace by 1 in the ECDF plots. This is likely to have only had small effects in the display. 
  * **Bugs in version 11.05**: 
     * BBOB R package became incompatible due to a not backwards compatible change in the API
  * **Bugs in version 11.04**:
     * bug in ppconferrorbars.py
     * bug in templateBBOB*.tex with Windows-paths
  * **Bugs in version 11.01**:
     * post-processcing: some wrong captions
  * **Bugs in version 11.00**:
     * Bugs in exampletiming.*: wrong test function
     * python experiments: renamed cocoexp to fgeneric
  * **Bugs in version 10.74**:
     * Bugs in latex templates
  * **Bugs in version 10.71**:
     * Bug in readalign.py
  * **Bugs in version 10.6**:
     * Post-processing: Bug in comparison tables which results in displaying 0.00 when ERT ratio is smaller than 0.01 (more than 100 times faster than the best algorithm from BBOB 2009)
     * Post-processing: Bug when changing the reference algorithm
  * **Bugs in version 10.4 and 10.5**:
     * Post-processing: Major bug that results in an underestimation of ERT. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to v10.6.
  * **Bugs in version 10.4**:
     * Post-processing: bug in bbob_pproc.comp2.pprldistr2 and potential bug with matplotlib 1.0.0, wrong data used for representing best BBOB 2009 and 2010
  * **Bugs in version 10.2**:
     * Post-processing: the significance test vs. the BBOB-2009 entry in Table 1 is wrongly computed when the BBOB-2009 entry did not reach the target function value.
  * **Bugs in version 10.1**:
     * Post-processing: the significance test in Figure 1 of the comparison template is wrongly computed.
     * Post-processing: running the runcomp2 routine with input parameters path0/samefoldername and path1/samefoldername processed only one data set.  
     * Java code: the attributes of JNIfgeneric.Params were not modifiable from outside the javabbob package.

  * **Bug in version 10.0**:
     * ECDF figures: data of the entries in 2009 were represented in a wrong manner, making them appear better than they actually were.
