Empirical runtime distributions (runtime in number of function evaluations divided by dimension) on all functions with target values in {100, ... , 1e-8} in dimension 10. The cross indicates the maximum number of function evaluations. A decline in steepness right after the cross (e.g. for IPOP-SEP-CMA-ES) indicates that the maximum number of function evaluations should have been chosen larger. A steep increase right after the cross (e.g. for simple GA) indicates that a restart should have been invoked earlier.
