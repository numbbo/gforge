Empirical runtime distributions on //separabale// functions (f1: Sphere, f2: Ellipsoid, f3: Rastrigin, f4: BÃ¼che-Rastrigin, f5: Linear Slope) with target values in {100, ..., 1e-8} in dimension 20.

The following algorithms perform particularly well up to their individual maximum number of function evaluations: //NEWUOA// (NEW Unconstraint Optimization Algorithm builds a second order model using 2n+1 points and with minimal Frobenius norm), //LSfminbnd// (Axis-parallel line search with MATLAB fminbnd univariate search) and //LSstep// (Axis-parallel line search with the univariate STEP Select The Easiest Point, based on interval division).
