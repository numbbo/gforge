This page is not public.

As for the uploads, the wiki users who have the rights can upload through the [[http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/lib/exe/mediamanager.php|media manager]] (also accessible by putting the link).

So to make it easier for them, the link will appear clearly in the [[bbob-2009-uploads]] page.

Here are the information that we can provide to the users:
  *To access the upload page http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2009-uploads, you will need to login as 'bbob' with the password 'upload'.
  *To upload a file click on bbob-2009-uploads on the right side panel and follow the instructions

Nota:
It seems there is a problem with the registration procedure which freezes at the validation of the registration. This rules out users registering on their own.

Nota2:
The montecarlo.pdf in upload should be the same as montecarlobbobpaper.pdf
It is there for practical purpose and can be removed as soon as another file is submitted in upload.

<html>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="uploader.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="262144000" /> <!-- 250MB --!>
Choose a file to upload: <input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /><br />
<input type="submit" value="Upload File" />
</form>
</html>

We want a procedure where people:
  *can upload certain file types (pdf, tar.gz, zip,...no executables...but why not?)
  *make sure those are not overwritten
  *they get a notification (could be done manually)
  *can deal with 2 people at the same time (nom auteur, nom de l'algo, noisy/noisefree)
  *upload directory invisible to people.
