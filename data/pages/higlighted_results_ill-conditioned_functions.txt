Empirical runtime distributions on //ill-conditioned// functions (f10: High conditioning Ellipsoid, f11: Discus, f12: Bent Cigar, f13: Sharp Ridge, f14: Different Powers) with target values in {100, ..., 1e-8} in dimension 20.

The following algorithms perform particularly well up to their individual maximum number of function evaluations: //GLOBAL// (Sampling, clustering and local search using BFGS or Nelder-Mead), //iAMALGAM// (Adapted Maximum-Likelihood Gaussian Model Iterated Density Estimation Algorithm with no-improvement stretch, anticipated mean shift and interlaced restarts with one large or several small populations  with incremental model building) and //BIPOP-CMA-ES// (CMA-ES restarted with budgets for small and large population size).
