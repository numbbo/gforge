== How to submit papers for the CEC-BBOB-2015 special session ==

While all papers have to be submitted via the normal CEC'2015 submission system at [[http://sites.ieee.org/cec2015/paper-submission/]] (please choose "SS23. CEC Black Box Optimization Benchmarking 2015"), we ask authors to follow an additional procedure regarding the data:

For each single paper submission (in addition to submitting the paper itself):
  - prepare an archive with the following files:
    * paper as pdf (required),
    * corresponding raw data (required if applicable),
    * algorithm source code or library (optional, but desired), including make files and/or calling script(s) like exampleexperiment.*. If a commercial optimizer was used, only the calling script(s) should be submitted.
  - upload the archive to a site of your choice, for example
    * https://mega.co.nz (no login required, encrypted) or 
    * https://www.dropbox.com/ 
  - email the download link to bbob _at_ lri.fr, mentioning paper title and authors


Submission deadline is <del>December 19, 2014</del> extended until <del>January 16, 2015</del> January 23, 2015
