== How to submit papers ==
For each single paper submission:
  - prepare an archive with the following files:
    * paper as pdf (required),
    * corresponding raw data (required if applicable),
    * algorithm source code or library (optional, but desired), including make files and/or calling script(s) like exampleexperiment.*. If a commercial optimizer was used, only the calling script(s) should be submitted.
  - upload the archive to a site of your choice, for example
    * https://mega.co.nz (no login required, encrypted) or 
    * https://www.dropbox.com/ 
  - email the download link to bbob _at_ lri.fr, mentioning paper title and authors
