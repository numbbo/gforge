====Evolutionary Computation Journal special issue====

===Call for papers===
Following the two BBOB GECCO workshops, we invite participants and other researchers to submit their original work on benchmarking optimizers for real-parameter black-box optimization for an ECJ special issue. Submissions can be extensions of works submitted at the workshops or new submissions. They should be original research which is not published nor currently under review by other journals or conferences. 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  *benchmarking results for new or not-so-new optimization algorithms (stochastic, deterministic, ...) for noise-free problems and / or noisy problems
  *comparison of optimization algorithms
  *design of benchmarking procedures

Researchers are welcome to use the COCO software platform which can be found in the [[downloads|download page]]. Researchers are also provided with all data collected during [[http://coco.lri.fr/BBOB2009|BBOB 2009]] and [[http://coco.lri.fr/BBOB2010|BBOB 2010]].

  *{{Call-for-papers.pdf|pdf}} of call for papers, the deadline is extended to end of September 2010
  *[[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/page/sub/evco | General guidelines and style files for submissions.]] Further supporting material and an ECJ style template that also includes graphs and tables generated by the COCO tools can be [[downloads|downloaded]]. 

===Submission===
Authors should submit their manuscripts until end of September to the Evolutionary Computation editorial manager
at http://ecj.lri.fr. When submitting a manuscript, at the same time an email should be sent
to Nikolaus Hansen (firstname.lastname@inria.fr) with copy to ecj@lri.fr mentioning the special
issue, paper title and authors to confirm the submission.

===Guest editors===
Anne Auger, Nikolaus Hansen and Marc Schoenauer
